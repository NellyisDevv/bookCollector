<!--
  Here is the code for the finished and not finished buttons that I removed from the add book div because they will be added back in the future inside of the actual book divs so that the users can choose after they added the book whether or not they finished reading it.
-->

<!--
          <div class="read-buttons">
            <button class="green-btn" id="read-btn">Finished</button>
            <button class="red-btn" id="not-read-btn">Not Finished</button>
          </div>
          -->
